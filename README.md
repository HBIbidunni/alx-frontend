# Welcome to my alx-frontend repository!
-------------
This repository contains various frontend development projects 
which explains the  web development practices in today's world.
These projects include `HTML/CSS`,`JavaScript/TypeScript`, and
`React`. Explained in detail here are the standards, scripts, and 
documentation that are to be used by the projects listed above.

## HTML basics — anatomy & semantics:
------------
Every HTML page follows a basic format:

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>

```

The __key elements__ of the HTML page include:
- `<!doctype html>` — This enables the standards mode.
- `<html lang="en">` — This sets the language for accessibility & search engines.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` — This code is required for character encoding.
- `<meta name="viewport"...>` — This is required for the responsive layout on mobile.

# The ALX Project - CSS advanced
---------------
This project explains the __Advanced CSS__ concepts which include 
the creation of a fully responsive, modern webpage by applying a 
combination of __CSS techniques__ such as `Flexbox`, `Grid`, `CSS Variables`, 
`Animations`, and `Media Queries`.

The creation of these __CSS techniques__ is to ensure proficiency in 
styling complex layouts, handling different screen sizes, and implementing 
interactive animations. At the finality of this project, the main goal is to be able to:
- Utilize __Flexbox__,__Grid__, and __advanced layout__ techniques.
- Build __Responsive Webpages__ to facilitate media queries and ensure 
the page is __responsive across__ multiple devices.
- Create visually appealing design layouts using animations and transitions.
- Utilize CSS variables that are maintainable and adapt to best practices
for clean reusable, and modular code.  

## Technologies Used
-------------
- `CSS3`: For styling, layout, and animations. Some aspects of CSS utilized include:

a)__Flexbox and CSS Grid__: This is for layout management.

b)__Media Queries__: Handles responsiveness in all forms.

c)__CSS Variables__: To be utilized for theming and design consistency.

d)__Animations and Transitions__: This are for interactive effects.

- `Git`: Version control for managing changes and collaboration.
- `Visual Studio Code`: Code editor used to write and test the project.

__Similarly, the Advanced CSS project contains:__

a) `index.html`: The __main HTML__ file which contains the structure of the webpage.

b) `style.css`: This contains the main stylesheet for the webpage which includes 
styles from typography to layout to animations.

c) `images`: A folder containing all the images utilized in the project. These images include __logos__ and __background.__  

__The features arising from these contents above include:__

a) `Responsive Design`: The webpage that arises from the responsive design and 
adjusts to different screen sizes which generally include mobile, tablet and desktop.

b) `Flexbox Layout`: Generally, the flexbox layout organizes the content sections in a flexible and dynamic way.

c) `CSS Grid Layout`: This is used in creating a more complex, grid-based structure for the webpage.

d) `Animations & Transitions`: The features that arise from this are smooth animations
that enhances hover effects and interactive transitions.

e) `Customizable Theme`: It is extremely important to have a customizable theme (CSS variables) that defines the primary colour scheme and font styles in such a way that makes modification of the design easy.


## Code Explanation
---------------

```
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;

- When there is a navigation through anchor links (`<a href="#section">`), 
the code shown above enables smooth scrolling, improves navigation experience
particularly for single-paged websites.


```
body {
  color: #161616;
}

a {
  color: #161616;
}

```

- The code above sets the dark shade which is (`#161616`) to the default text 
colour ensuring that they are clear and highly
